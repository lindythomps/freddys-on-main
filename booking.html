                    <h3>Deposit</h3>
                    <p>Half due upon booking, please book using our link and choose 'pay later' if you prefer to use eTransfer. Credit Card is also accepted. The other half of the booking is due 4 months prior to event. If cancellation is made prior to 4 months, half of the original deposit is refundable. If cancellation is made after 4 months, the amount of the original deposit is non-refundable.</p>

                    <h3>Cleaning + Security</h3>
                    <p>A cleaning and security deposit of $250 will be taken two weeks prior to the event which will be fully refuned once the building is returned in the same order it was found in. All garbage disposed of in the bins across from the back alley, floors swept, spills wiped, bathrooms checked.</p>

                    <h3>Staffing Options</h3>
                    <p>If you'd prefer a much more hands-off approach to cleaning-set-up, we have a capable staff available for hire at minimum wage to appropriately handle any tasks you would like filled either the day before, day of, or day after your event. A security deposit will be taken either way, but the cleaning/garbage removal and other duties can be completely managed by us if that is your preference!</p>

                    <h3>Elopement</h3>
                    <p>If your wedding is booked less than three months away, you qualify for the special 40% off elopement pricing. The full deposit amount will be due upon booking, and only half will be refunded if cancelled at any time after the booking is made.</p>

                    <h3>24 Hours+</h3>
                    <p>Officially, your booking secures you 24 hours starting at midnight and ending at midnight. However, if no one has booked the day before OR the day after your booking feel free to take that extra time included free with you reservation. If another party does wish to book the space for their event either the day before or after yours, the reservation will be taken with them as well, and often wedding parties have cooperated together sharing decor and rentals as well as the work of setup/takedown.</p>
